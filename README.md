# Q_Learning

This is the project I decided to do for EECS 4401--An Artificial Intelligence Course 

Training Result for the snake game:

My implementation for Q-learning: [Q_Learner.java](https://github.com/ShiyiDu/Q_Learning_Java/blob/master/src/Shiyi/Q_Learner.java)

I also created 2 smaller games to test my Q-Learning Algorithm. To read more about the project, you can read the [Project_Report.pdf](https://github.com/ShiyiDu/Q_Learning_Java/raw/master/EECS%204401%20Project%20Report.pdf). located at root folder

The code is messy, and there's a lot of dependencies I used that are cross-platform. But you can try to see the training in action by running one of the following in the Main File, although you have to make sure to include all the dependencies located at lib folder that might not work well on your system :(
initAppleFinderGame();
initSnakeGame();
initSnakeGame2();
